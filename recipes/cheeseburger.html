    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The ultimate bacon cheeseburger with beef cooked in bacon fat, a bacon fat mayonnaise, onions caramelized in bacon fat, buns toasted in bacon fat, and a crisp bacon weave topping.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds 80&#47;20 beef</li>
        <li>1&#47;3 cup of heavy cream</li>
        <li>6 to 8 dashes hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 dashes worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1&#47;2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>6 kaiser rolls</li>
        <li>softened butter</li>
        <li>6 slices cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>6 slices cooked bacon, halved</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the beef into a medium mixing bowl. Add the cream, hot sauce, Worcestershire, salt and pepper. With clean hands, mix the meat well. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Next, slice the rolls in half and spread each half with some softened butter. Place the rolls face-down on a skillet over medium heat. Lightly grill the rolls so they're nice and golden. Let the rolls cool on a plate until you need them.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add the butter. Form the beef mixture into 6 patties and place in the skillet, in batches if needed. Allow each to cook about 4 minutes on the first side, flip them and place a slice of Cheddar on to melt.</li>
        <li>When the patties are done in the middle, place them on the base of the halved buns. Top each with 2 pieces of the bacon and top with the other half of the rolls.</li>
    </ol>
